If you wish to get started as quickly as possible, use our built-in **Sandbox Integration (HRIS/ATS)**.
You can find it in the **"Integrations"** section in the Kombo dashboard. The sandbox integration
is only available in development environments.

Otherwise, some tools offer free demo accounts that you can use to test out Kombo.
Here are some examples:

- [Personio (HRIS)](https://www.personio.com/free-trial/)
- [Recruitee (ATS)](https://auth.recruitee.com/sign-up)
- [BambooHR (HRIS)](https://www.bamboohr.com/signup/)
- [Sage HR (HRIS/ATS)](https://sage.hr/register)

<Note>
  We recommend using Personio for testing HRIS integrations and Recruitee for testing ATS integrations, as these tools
  provide great feature coverage and are broadly used.

### Enterprise tools

Enterprise tools like Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, or SmartRecruiters usually
don't offer free sandbox access. However, for customers on the yearly
contract, we offer joint testing sessions with these enterprise tools.
